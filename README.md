Program for managing bike club. Project was initially on Azure cloud, so here I have only final version. It was made as a group project by a group of four but we ended only with two. The case study is in pdf file "StudyCase_BikeClub_

## Task
The aim of this project was to practise software engineering skills. We started with doing user cases and diagram clases in UML. And later we started implementing three layer architekture 

## Compilation
Unfortunatly it compiles well only with Visual Studio 2015 as same functionalities probably were removed in following editions. Also Entity Framework and NuGet are necessary.
